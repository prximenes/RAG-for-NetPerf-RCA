              vice when the size is greater than 65536.

       gso_ipv4_max_size BYTES
              specifies the recommended maximum size of a IPv4 Generic Segment Offload packet the new device should accept. This is especially used to enable BIG TCP for IPv4 on
              this device by setting to a size greater than 65536.  Note that gso_max_size needs to be set to a size greater than or equal to gso_ipv4_max_size to really  enable
              BIG TCP for IPv4.

       gso_max_segs SEGMENTS
              specifies the recommended maximum number of a Generic Segment Offload segments the new device should accept.

       gro_max_size BYTES
              specifies  the  maximum size of a packet built by GRO stack on this device. This is also used for BIG TCP to allow the size of a merged IPv6 GSO packet on this de‐
              vice greater than 65536.

       gro_ipv4_max_size BYTES
              specifies the maximum size of a IPv4 packet built by GRO stack on this device. This is especially used for BIG TCP to allow the size of a merged IPv4 GSO packet on
              this device greater than 65536.

       index IDX
              specifies the desired index of the new virtual device. The link creation fails, if the index is busy.

       netns  { PID | NETNSNAME | NETNSFILE }
              create the device in the network namespace associated with process PID or the name NETNSNAME or the file NETNSFILE.

       VLAN Type Support
              For a link of type VLAN the following additional arguments are supported:

              ip link add link DEVICE name NAME type vlan [ protocol VLAN_PROTO ] id VLANID [ reorder_hdr { on | off } ] [ gvrp { on | off  }  ]  [  mvrp  {  on  |  off  }  ]  [
              loose_binding { on | off } ] [ bridge_binding { on | off } ] [ ingress-qos-map QOS-MAP ] [ egress-qos-map QOS-MAP ]

                      protocol VLAN_PROTO - either 802.1Q or 802.1ad.

                      id VLANID - specifies the VLAN Identifier to use. Note that numbers with a leading " 0 " or " 0x " are interpreted as octal or hexadecimal, respectively.

                      reorder_hdr { on | off } - specifies whether ethernet headers are reordered or not (default is on).

                          If  reorder_hdr is on then VLAN header will be not inserted immediately but only before passing to the physical device (if this device does not support
                          VLAN offloading), the similar on the RX direction - by default the packet will be untagged before being received by VLAN device. Reordering allows  one
                          to  accelerate tagging on egress and to hide VLAN header on ingress so the packet looks like regular Ethernet packet, at the same time it might be con‐
                          fusing for packet capture as the VLAN header does not exist within the packet.

                          VLAN offloading can be checked by ethtool(8):

                              ethtool -k <phy_dev> | grep tx-vlan-offload

                          where <phy_dev> is the physical device to which VLAN device is bound.

                      gvrp { on | off } - specifies whether this VLAN should be registered using GARP VLAN Registration Protocol.

                      mvrp { on | off } - specifies whether this VLAN should be registered using Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol.

                      loose_binding { on | off } - specifies whether the VLAN device state is bound to the physical device state.

                      bridge_binding { on | off } - specifies whether the VLAN device link state tracks the state of bridge ports that are members of the VLAN.

                      ingress-qos-map QOS-MAP - defines a mapping of VLAN header prio field to the Linux internal packet priority on incoming frames. The format is FROM:TO  with
                      multiple mappings separated by spaces.

                      egress-qos-map  QOS-MAP  - defines a mapping of Linux internal packet priority to VLAN header prio field but for outgoing frames. The format is the same as
                      for ingress-qos-map.

                          Linux packet priority can be set by iptables(8):

                              iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING [...] -j CLASSIFY --set-class 0:4

                          and this "4" priority can be used in the egress qos mapping to set VLAN prio "5":

                              ip link set veth0.10 type vlan egress 4:5

       VXLAN Type Support
              For a link of type VXLAN the following additional arguments are supported:

              ip link add DEVICE type vxlan id VNI [ dev PHYS_DEV  ] [ { group | remote } IPADDR ] [ local { IPADDR | any } ] [ ttl TTL ] [ tos TOS ]  [  df  DF  ]  [  flowlabel
              FLOWLABEL ] [ dstport PORT ] [ srcport MIN MAX ] [ reserved_bits VALUE ] [ [no]learning ] [ [no]proxy ] [ [no]rsc ] [ [no]l2miss ] [ [no]l3miss ] [ [no]udpcsum ] [
              [no]udp6zerocsumtx  ]  [  [no]udp6zerocsumrx  ]  [  [no]localbypass ] [ ageing SECONDS ] [ maxaddress NUMBER ] [ [no]external ] [ gbp ] [ gpe ] [ [no]vnifilter ] [
              [no]mcroute ]

                      id VNI - specifies the VXLAN Network Identifier (or VXLAN Segment Identifier) to use.

                      dev PHYS_DEV - specifies the physical device to use for tunnel endpoint communication.

                      group IPADDR - specifies the multicast IP address to join.  This parameter cannot be specified with the remote parameter.

                      remote IPADDR - specifies the unicast destination IP address to use in outgoing packets when the destination link layer address is not known in  the  VXLAN
                      device forwarding database. This parameter cannot be specified with the group parameter.

                      local IPADDR - specifies the source IP address to use in outgoing packets.

                      ttl TTL - specifies the TTL value to use in outgoing packets.

                      tos TOS - specifies the TOS value to use in outgoing packets.

                      df  DF  - specifies the usage of the Don't Fragment flag (DF) bit in outgoing packets with IPv4 headers. The value inherit causes the bit to be copied from
                      the original IP header. The values unset and set cause the bit to be always unset or always set, respectively. By default, the bit is not set.

                      flowlabel FLOWLABEL - specifies the flow label to use in outgoing packets.

                      dstport PORT - specifies the UDP destination port to communicate to the remote
                        VXLAN tunnel endpoint.

                      srcport MIN MAX - specifies the range of port numbers to use as UDP source ports to communicate to the remote VXLAN tunnel endpoint.

                      reserved_bits VALUE - by default the kernel rejects packets that have bits set outside of the fields required by the features enabled on the  VXLAN  netde‐
                      vice. reserved_bits is a 64-bit quantity specifying which bits it should be possible to set in a VXLAN header. Each bit set in the value is a tolerated bit
                      set in a packet.

                      [no]learning - specifies if unknown source link layer addresses and IP addresses are entered into the VXLAN device forwarding database.

                      [no]rsc - specifies if route short circuit is turned on.

                      [no]proxy - specifies ARP proxy is turned on.

                      [no]l2miss - specifies if netlink LLADDR miss notifications are generated.

                      [no]l3miss - specifies if netlink IP ADDR miss notifications are generated.

                      [no]udpcsum - specifies if UDP checksum is calculated for transmitted packets over IPv4.

                      [no]udp6zerocsumtx - skip UDP checksum calculation for transmitted packets over IPv6.

                      [no]udp6zerocsumrx - allow incoming UDP packets over IPv6 with zero checksum field.

                      [no]localbypass - if FDB destination is local, with nolocalbypass set, forward encapsulated packets to the userspace network stack. If there is a userspace
                      process  listening for these packets, it will have a chance to process them. If localbypass is active (default), bypass the kernel network stack and inject
                      the packets into the target VXLAN device, assuming one exists.

                      ageing SECONDS - specifies the lifetime in seconds of FDB entries learnt by the kernel.

                      maxaddress NUMBER - specifies the maximum number of FDB entries.

                      [no]external - specifies whether an external control plane (e.g. ip route encap) or the internal FDB should be used.

                      [no]vnifilter - specifies whether the vxlan device is capable of vni filtering. Only works with a vxlan device with external flag set. once enabled, bridge
                      vni command is used to manage the vni filtering table on the device. The device can only receive packets with vni's configured in the vni filtering table.

                      [no]mcroute - when the VXLAN tunnel has a multicast remote, whether the underlay packets should be sent directly to the physical device (the  default),  or
                      whether  they should be multicast-routed. In the latter case, for purposes of matching a multicast route, (S,G) are, respectively, local and remote address
                      of the tunnel, and iif is the tunnel physical device.

                      gbp - enables the Group Policy extension (VXLAN-GBP).

                          Allows one to transport group policy context across VXLAN network peers.  If enabled, includes the mark of a packet in the VXLAN  header  for  outgoing
                          packets and fills the packet mark based on the information found in the VXLAN header for incoming packets.

                          Format of upper 16 bits of packet mark (flags);

                            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                            |-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|D|-|-|A|-|-|-|
                            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                            D := Don't Learn bit. When set, this bit indicates that the egress VTEP MUST NOT learn the source address of the encapsulated frame.

                            A := Indicates that the group policy has already been applied to this packet. Policies MUST NOT be applied by devices when the A bit is set.

                          Format of lower 16 bits of packet mark (policy ID):

                            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                            |        Group Policy ID        |
                            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                      scrub  SCRUB  -  specifies  the  scrub  behavior  of  the  netkit device with "default" and "none" as possible values. With "default" the device zeroes the
                      skb->{mark,priority} fields before invoking the attached BPF program when its peer device resides in a different network namespace. With "none" the  device
                      leaves  clearing skb->{mark,priority} up to the BPF program. Default option is "default". Specifying scrub before the peer option refers to the primary de‐
                      vice, after the peer option refers to the peer device.

                      POLICY - specifies the default device policy when no BPF programs are attached with "forward" and "blackhole" as possible values. Default option  is  "for‐
                      ward". Specifying policy before the peer option refers to the primary device, after the peer option refers to the peer device.

                      local ADDR - specifies the fixed local address for tunneled packets.  It must be an address on another interface on this host.

                      encap { fou | gue | none } - specifies type of secondary UDP encapsulation. "fou" indicates Foo-Over-UDP, "gue" indicates Generic UDP Encapsulation.

                      encap-sport  {  PORT  |  auto } - specifies the source port in UDP encapsulation.  PORT indicates the port by number, "auto" indicates that the port number
                      should be chosen automatically (the kernel picks a flow based on the flow hash of the encapsulated packet).

                      [no]encap-csum - specifies if UDP checksums are enabled in the secondary encapsulation.

                      [no]encap-remcsum - specifies if Remote Checksum Offload is enabled. This is only applicable for Generic UDP Encapsulation.

                      mode { ip6ip | ipip | mplsip | any } - specifies mode in which device should run. "ip6ip"  indicates  IPv6-Over-IPv4,  "ipip"  indicates  "IPv4-Over-IPv4",
                      "mplsip"  indicates MPLS-Over-IPv4, "any" indicates IPv6, IPv4 or MPLS Over IPv4. Supported for SIT where the default is "ip6ip" and IPIP where the default
                      is "ipip".  IPv6-Over-IPv4 is not supported for IPIP.

                      [no][i|o]seq - serialize packets.  The oseq flag enables sequencing of outgoing packets.  The iseq flag requires that all input packets are serialized.

                      [i|o]key KEY | no[i|o]key - use keyed GRE with key KEY. KEY is either a number or an IPv4 address-like dotted quad.  The key parameter specifies  the  same
                      key to use in both directions.  The ikey and okey parameters specify different keys for input and output.

                      [no][i|o]csum  -  generate/require checksums for tunneled packets.  The ocsum flag calculates checksums for outgoing packets.  The icsum flag requires that
                      all input packets have the correct checksum. The csum flag is equivalent to the combination icsum ocsum .

                      ttl TTL - specifies the TTL value to use in outgoing packets.

                      tos TOS - specifies the TOS value to use in outgoing packets.

                      [no]pmtudisc - enables/disables Path MTU Discovery on this tunnel.  It is enabled by default. Note that a fixed ttl is incompatible with this option:  tun‐
                      neling with a fixed ttl always makes pmtu discovery.

                      [no]ignore-df  -  enables/disables  IPv4  DF suppression on this tunnel.  Normally datagrams that exceed the MTU will be fragmented; the presence of the DF
                      flag inhibits this, resulting instead in an ICMP Unreachable (Fragmentation Required) message.  Enabling this attribute causes the DF flag to be ignored.

                      dev PHYS_DEV - specifies the physical device to use for tunnel endpoint communication.

                      encap { fou | gue | none } - specifies type of secondary UDP encapsulation. "fou" indicates Foo-Over-UDP, "gue" indicates Generic UDP Encapsulation.

                      encap-sport { PORT | auto } - specifies the source port in UDP encapsulation.  PORT indicates the port by number, "auto" indicates  that  the  port  number
                      should be chosen automatically (the kernel picks a flow based on the flow hash of the encapsulated packet).

                      [no]encap-csum - specifies if UDP checksums are enabled in the secondary encapsulation.

                      [no]encap-remcsum - specifies if Remote Checksum Offload is enabled. This is only applicable for Generic UDP Encapsulation.

                      external - make this tunnel externally controlled (e.g. ip route encap).

       IP6GRE/IP6GRETAP Type Support

              caplimit ELIM ] [ tclass TCLASS ] [ flowlabel FLOWLABEL ] [ dscp inherit ] [ [no]allow-localremote ] [ dev PHYS_DEV ] [ external ]

                      remote ADDR - specifies the remote IPv6 address of the tunnel.

                      local ADDR - specifies the fixed local IPv6 address for tunneled packets.  It must be an address on another interface on this host.

                      [no][i|o]seq - serialize packets.  The oseq flag enables sequencing of outgoing packets.  The iseq flag requires that all input packets are serialized.

                      [i|o]key KEY | no[i|o]key - use keyed GRE with key KEY. KEY is either a number or an IPv4 address-like dotted quad.  The key parameter specifies  the  same
                      key to use in both directions.  The ikey and okey parameters specify different keys for input and output.

                      [no][i|o]csum  -  generate/require checksums for tunneled packets.  The ocsum flag calculates checksums for outgoing packets.  The icsum flag requires that
                      all input packets have the correct checksum. The csum flag is equivalent to the combination icsum ocsum.

                      hoplimit TTL - specifies Hop Limit value to use in outgoing packets.

                      encaplimit ELIM - specifies a fixed encapsulation limit. Default is 4.

                      flowlabel FLOWLABEL - specifies a fixed flowlabel.

                      [no]allow-localremote - specifies whether to allow remote endpoint to have an address configured on local host.

                      tclass TCLASS - specifies the traffic class field on tunneled packets, which can be specified as either a two-digit hex value (e.g.  c0)  or  a  predefined
                      string  (e.g. internet).  The value inherit causes the field to be copied from the original IP header. The values inherit/STRING or inherit/00..ff will set
                      the field to STRING or 00..ff when tunneling non-IP packets. The default value is 00.

                      external - make this tunnel externally controlled (or not, which is the default).  In the kernel, this is referred to as collect metadata mode.  This  flag
                      is mutually exclusive with the remote, local, seq, key, csum, hoplimit, encaplimit, flowlabel and tclass options.

       IPoIB Type Support

              erspan_hwid hwid ] [ [no]allow-localremote ] [ external ]

                      remote ADDR - specifies the remote address of the tunnel.

                      local ADDR - specifies the fixed local address for tunneled packets.  It must be an address on another interface on this host.

                      erspan_ver version - specifies the ERSPAN version number.  version indicates the ERSPAN version to be created: 0 for version 0 type  I,  1  for  version  1
                      (type II) or 2 for version 2 (type III).

                      erspan IDX - specifies the ERSPAN v1 index field.  IDX indicates a 20 bit index/port number associated with the ERSPAN traffic's source port and direction.

                      erspan_dir { ingress | egress } - specifies the ERSPAN v2 mirrored traffic's direction.

                      erspan_hwid hwid - an unique identifier of an ERSPAN v2 engine within a system.  hwid is a 6-bit value for users to configure.

                      id VNI - specifies the Virtual Network Identifier to use.

                      remote IPADDR - specifies the unicast destination IP address to use in outgoing packets.

                      ttl  TTL - specifies the TTL value to use in outgoing packets. "0" or "auto" means use whatever default value, "inherit" means inherit the inner protocol's
                      ttl. Default option is "0".

                      tos TOS - specifies the TOS value to use in outgoing packets.

                      df DF - specifies the usage of the Don't Fragment flag (DF) bit in outgoing packets with IPv4 headers. The value inherit causes the bit to be  copied  from
                      the original IP header. The values unset and set cause the bit to be always unset or always set, respectively. By default, the bit is not set.

                      dstport PORT - select a destination port other than the default of 6081.

                      [no]external  -  make  this  tunnel externally controlled (or not, which is the default). This flag is mutually exclusive with the id, remote, ttl, tos and
                      flowlabel options.

                      [no]udpcsum - specifies if UDP checksum is calculated for transmitted packets over IPv4.

                      [no]udp6zerocsumrx - allow incoming UDP packets over IPv6 with zero checksum field.

                      innerprotoinherit - use IPv4/IPv6 as inner protocol instead of Ethernet.

       Bareudp Type Support
              For a link of type Bareudp the following additional arguments are supported:

              ip link add DEVICE type bareudp dstport PORT ethertype PROTO [ srcportmin PORT ] [ [no]multiproto ]

                      dstport PORT - specifies the destination port for the UDP tunnel.

                      ethertype PROTO - specifies the ethertype of the L3 protocol being tunnelled.  ethertype can be given as plain Ethernet protocol number or using the proto‐
                      col name ("ipv4", "ipv6", "mpls_uc", etc.).

                      srcportmin PORT - selects the lowest value of the UDP tunnel source port range.

                      [no]multiproto - activates support for protocols similar to the one specified by ethertype.  When ethertype is "mpls_uc" (that is, unicast MPLS), this  al‐
                      lows the tunnel to also handle multicast MPLS.  When ethertype is "ipv4", this allows the tunnel to also handle IPv6. This option is disabled by default.

       AMT Type Support
              For a link of type AMT the following additional arguments are supported:

              ip link add DEVICE type AMT discovery IPADDR mode { gateway | relay } local IPADDR dev PHYS_DEV [ relay_port PORT ] [ gateway_port PORT ] [ max_tunnels NUMBER ]

                      discovery IPADDR - specifies the unicast discovery IP address to use to find remote IP address.

                      mode { gateway | relay } - specifies the role of AMT, Gateway or Relay

                      local IPADDR - specifies the source IP address to use in outgoing packets.

                      dev PHYS_DEV - specifies the underlying physical interface from which transform traffic is sent and received.

                      relay_port PORT - specifies the UDP Relay port to communicate to the Relay.

                      gateway_port PORT - specifies the UDP Gateway port to communicate to the Gateway.

                      max_tunnels NUMBER - specifies the maximum number of tunnels.

       MACVLAN and MACVTAP Type Support
              For a link of type MACVLAN or MACVTAP the following additional arguments are supported:

              ip link add link DEVICE name NAME type { macvlan | macvtap } mode { private | vepa | bridge | passthru  [ nopromisc ] | source [ nodst ] }  [ bcqueuelen { LENGTH }
              ]  [ bclim LIMIT ]

                      type  {  macvlan | macvtap } - specifies the link type to use.  macvlan creates just a virtual interface, while macvtap in addition creates a character de‐
                      vice /dev/tapX to be used just like a tuntap device.

                      mode private - Do not allow communication between macvlan instances on the same physical interface, even if the external switch supports hairpin mode.

                      mode vepa - Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator mode. Data from one macvlan instance to the other on the same physical interface is transmitted over the phys‐
                      ical interface. Either the attached switch needs to support hairpin mode, or there must be a TCP/IP router forwarding the packets in order to allow  commu‐
                      nication. This is the default mode.

                      mode bridge - In bridge mode, all endpoints are directly connected to each other, communication is not redirected through the physical interface's peer.

                      mode passthru [ nopromisc ] - This mode gives more power to a single endpoint, usually in macvtap mode. It is not allowed for more than one endpoint on the
                      same  physical  interface. All traffic will be forwarded to this endpoint, allowing virtio guests to change MAC address or set promiscuous mode in order to
                      bridge the interface or create vlan interfaces on top of it. By default, this mode forces the underlying interface into promiscuous mode. Passing  the  no‐
                      promisc flag prevents this, so the promisc flag may be controlled using standard tools.

                      mode source [ nodst ] - allows one to set a list of allowed mac address, which is used to match against source mac address from received frames on underly‐
                      ing  interface.  This  allows creating mac based VLAN associations, instead of standard port or tag based. The feature is useful to deploy 802.1x mac based
                      behavior, where drivers of underlying interfaces doesn't allows that. By default, packets are also considered (duplicated) for  destination-based  MACVLAN.
                      Passing the nodst flag stops matching packets from also going through the destination-based flow.

                      bcqueuelen  {  LENGTH  }  - Set the length of the RX queue used to process broadcast and multicast packets.  LENGTH must be a positive integer in the range
                      [0-4294967295].  Setting a length of 0 will effectively drop all broadcast/multicast traffic.  If not specified the macvlan driver default (1000) is  used.
                      Note  that  all macvlans that share the same underlying device are using the same queue. The parameter here is a request, the actual queue length used will
                      be the maximum length that any macvlan interface has requested.  When listing device parameters both the bcqueuelen parameter as well as  the  actual  used
                      bcqueuelen are listed to better help the user understand the setting.

                      bclim  LIMIT - Set the threshold for broadcast queueing.  LIMIT must be a 32-bit integer.  Setting this to -1 disables broadcast queueing altogether.  Oth‐
                      erwise a multicast address will be queued as broadcast if the number of devices using it is greater than the given value.

       High-availability Seamless Redundancy (HSR) Support
              For a link of type HSR the following additional arguments are supported:

              ip link add link DEVICE name NAME type hsr slave1 SLAVE1-IF slave2 SLAVE2-IF [ interlink INTERLINK-IF ] [ supervision ADDR-BYTE ] [ version { 0 | 1 } [ proto { 0 |

                      supervision ADDR-BYTE - The last byte of the multicast address used for HSR supervision frames.  Default option is "0", possible values 0-255.

                      version { 0 | 1 } - Selects the protocol version of the interface. Default option is "0", which corresponds to the 2010 version of the HSR standard. Option
                      "1" activates the 2012 version.

                      proto { 0 | 1 } - Selects the protocol at the interface. Default option is "0", which corresponds to the HSR standard. Option "1"  activates  the  Parallel

                      ageing_time AGEING_TIME - configure the bridge's FDB entries ageing time, ie the number of seconds a MAC address will be kept in the FDB after a packet has
                      been received from that address. after this time has passed, entries are cleaned up.

                      group_fwd_mask  MASK  - set the group forward mask. This is the bitmask that is applied to decide whether to forward incoming frames destined to link-local
                      addresses, ie addresses of the form 01:80:C2:00:00:0X (defaults to 0, ie the bridge does not forward any link-local frames).

                      group_address ADDRESS - set the MAC address of the multicast group this bridge uses for STP.  The address must be a link-local address in standard Ethernet
                      MAC address format, ie an address of the form 01:80:C2:00:00:0X, with X
                       in [0, 4..f].

                      forward_delay FORWARD_DELAY - set the forwarding delay in seconds, ie the time spent in LISTENING state (before moving to LEARNING) and in  LEARNING  state
                      (before moving to FORWARDING). Only relevant if STP is enabled. Valid values are between 2 and 30.

                      hello_time  HELLO_TIME - set the time in seconds between hello packets sent by the bridge, when it is a root bridge or a designated bridges.  Only relevant
                      if STP is enabled. Valid values are between 1 and 10.

                      max_age MAX_AGE - set the hello packet timeout, ie the time in seconds until another bridge in the spanning tree is assumed to be dead, after reception  of
                      its last hello message. Only relevant if STP is enabled. Valid values are between 6 and 40.

                      stp_state STP_STATE - turn spanning tree protocol on (STP_STATE > 0) or off (STP_STATE == 0).  for this bridge.

                      mst_enabled MST_ENABLED - turn multiple spanning tree (MST) support on (MST_ENABLED > 0) or off (MST_ENABLED == 0).  When enabled, sets of VLANs can be as‐
                      sociated  with multiple spanning tree instances (MSTIs), and STP states for each port can be controlled on a per-MSTI basis. Note: no implementation of the
                      MSTP protocol is provided, only the primitives needed to implement it. To avoid interfering with the legacy per-VLAN STP states, this setting can  only  be
                      changed when no bridge VLANs are configured.

                      priority PRIORITY - set this bridge's spanning tree priority, used during STP root bridge election.  PRIORITY is a 16bit unsigned integer.

                      no_linklocal_learn  NO_LINKLOCAL_LEARN  - turn link-local learning on (NO_LINKLOCAL_LEARN == 0) or off (NO_LINKLOCAL_LEARN > 0).  When disabled, the bridge
                      will not learn from link-local frames (default: enabled).

                      fdb_local_vlan_0 FDB_LOCAL_VLAN_0 When disabled, local FDB entries (i.e. those for member port addresses and address of the bridge itself) are kept at VLAN
                      0 as well as any member VLANs.  When the option is enabled, they are only kept at VLAN 0. By default the option is disabled.

                      When this option is enabled, when making a forwarding decision, the bridge looks at VLAN 0 for a matching entry that is permanent, but not added  by  user.
                      However  in  all other ways the entry only exists on VLAN 0. This affects dumping, where the entries are not shown on non-0 VLANs, and FDB get and flush do
                      not find the entry on non-0 VLANs. When the entry is deleted, it affects forwarding on all VLANs.

                      fdb_max_learned FDB_MAX_LEARNED - set the maximum number of learned FDB entries. If  (FDB_MAX_LEARNED  ==  0)  the  feature  is  disabled.  Default  is  0.

                      vlan_filtering  VLAN_FILTERING - turn VLAN filtering on (VLAN_FILTERING > 0) or off (VLAN_FILTERING == 0).  When disabled, the bridge will not consider the
                      VLAN tag when handling packets.

                      vlan_protocol { 802.1Q | 802.1ad } - set the protocol used for VLAN filtering.

                      vlan_default_pvid VLAN_DEFAULT_PVID - set the default PVID (native/untagged VLAN ID) for this bridge.

                      vlan_stats_per_port VLAN_STATS_PER_PORT - enable (VLAN_STATS_PER_PORT == 1) or disable (VLAN_STATS_PER_PORT == 0) per-VLAN per-port stats  accounting.  Can
                      be changed only when there are no port VLANs configured.

                      mcast_snooping MULTICAST_SNOOPING - turn multicast snooping on (MULTICAST_SNOOPING > 0) or off (MULTICAST_SNOOPING == 0).

                      mcast_vlan_snooping MULTICAST_VLAN_SNOOPING - turn multicast VLAN snooping on (MULTICAST_VLAN_SNOOPING > 0) or off (MULTICAST_VLAN_SNOOPING == 0).

                      mcast_router MULTICAST_ROUTER - set bridge's multicast router if IGMP snooping is enabled.  MULTICAST_ROUTER is an integer value having the following mean‐
                      ing:

                      mcast_last_member_count LAST_MEMBER_COUNT - set multicast last member count, ie the number of queries the bridge will send  before  stopping  forwarding  a
                      multicast group after a "leave" message has been received (defaults to 2).

                      mcast_last_member_interval LAST_MEMBER_INTERVAL - interval between queries to find remaining members of a group, after a "leave" message is received.

                      mcast_startup_query_count STARTUP_QUERY_COUNT - set the number of IGMP queries to send during startup phase (defaults to 2).

       group GROUP
              specifies the group of virtual links to delete. Group 0 is not allowed to be deleted since it is the default group.

       type TYPE
              specifies the type of the device.

   ip link set - change device attributes
       Warning: If multiple parameter changes are requested, ip aborts immediately after any of the changes have failed.  This is the only case when ip can move the system to an
       unpredictable state. The solution is to avoid changing several parameters with one ip link set call.  The modifier change is equivalent to set.

       dev DEVICE
              DEVICE  specifies network device to operate on. When configuring SR-IOV Virtual Function (VF) devices, this keyword should specify the associated Physical Function
              (PF) device.

       group GROUP
              GROUP has a dual role: If both group and dev are present, then move the device to the specified group. If only a group is specified, then the command  operates  on
              all devices in that group.

       up and down
              change the state of the device to UP or DOWN.

       arp on or arp off
              change the NOARP flag on the device.

       multicast on or multicast off
              change the MULTICAST flag on the device.

       allmulticast on or allmulticast off
              change  the  ALLMULTI  flag on the device. When enabled, instructs network driver to retrieve all multicast packets from the network to the kernel for further pro‐
              cessing.

       promisc on or promisc off
              change the PROMISC flag on the device. When enabled, activates promiscuous operation of the network device.

       trailers on or trailers off
              change the NOTRAILERS flag on the device, NOT used by the Linux and exists for BSD compatibility.

       protodown on or protodown off
              change the PROTODOWN state on the device. Indicates that a protocol error has been detected on the port. Switch drivers can react to this error  by  doing  a  phys
              down on the switch port.

       protodown_reason PREASON on or off
              set PROTODOWN reasons on the device. protodown reason bit names can be enumerated under /etc/iproute2/protodown_reasons.d/. possible reasons bits 0-31

       dynamic on or dynamic off
              change the DYNAMIC flag on the device. Indicates that address can change when interface goes down (currently NOT used by the Linux).

       name NAME
              change the name of the device. This operation is not recommended if the device is running or has some addresses already configured.

       txqueuelen NUMBER

       txqlen NUMBER
              change the transmit queue length of the device.

       mtu NUMBER
              change the MTU of the device.

       address LLADDRESS
              change the station address of the interface.

       broadcast LLADDRESS

       brd LLADDRESS

       peer LLADDRESS
              change the link layer broadcast address or the peer address when the interface is POINTOPOINT.

       netns  { PID | NETNSNAME | NETNSFILE }
              move the device to the network namespace associated with process PID or the name NETNSNAME or the file NETNSFILE.

              Some  devices  are not allowed to change network namespace: loopback, bridge, wireless. These are network namespace local devices. In such case ip tool will return
              "Invalid argument" error. It is possible to find out if device is local to a single network namespace by checking netns-local flag in the output of the ethtool:

                      ethtool -k DEVICE

              To change network namespace for wireless devices the iw tool can be used. But it allows one to change network namespace only for physical devices  and  by  process
              PID.

       alias NAME
              give the device a symbolic name for easy reference.

       group GROUP
              specify the group the device belongs to.  The available groups are listed in /usr/share/iproute2/group or /etc/iproute2/group (has precedence if exists).

       vf NUM specify a Virtual Function device to be configured. The associated PF device must be specified using the dev parameter.

                      mac LLADDRESS - change the station address for the specified VF. The vf parameter must be specified.

                      vlan VLANID - change the assigned VLAN for the specified VF. When specified, all traffic sent from the VF will be tagged with the specified VLAN ID. Incom‐
                      ing  traffic  will  be  filtered for the specified VLAN ID, and will have all VLAN tags stripped before being passed to the VF. Setting this parameter to 0
                      disables VLAN tagging and filtering. The vf parameter must be specified.

                      qos VLAN-QOS - assign VLAN QOS (priority) bits for the VLAN tag. When specified, all VLAN tags transmitted by the VF will include  the  specified  priority
                      bits  in  the  VLAN  tag. If not specified, the value is assumed to be 0. Both the vf and vlan parameters must be specified. Setting both vlan and qos as 0
                      disables VLAN tagging and filtering for the VF.

                      proto VLAN-PROTO - assign VLAN PROTOCOL for the VLAN tag, either 802.1Q or 802.1ad.  Setting to 802.1ad, all traffic sent from the VF will be  tagged  with
                      VLAN  S-Tag.   Incoming traffic will have VLAN S-Tags stripped before being passed to the VF.  Setting to 802.1ad also enables an option to concatenate an‐
                      other VLAN tag, so both S-TAG and C-TAG will be inserted/stripped for outgoing/incoming traffic, respectively.  If not specified, the value is  assumed  to
                      be 802.1Q. Both the vf and vlan parameters must be specified.

                      rate  TXRATE  --  change  the allowed transmit bandwidth, in Mbps, for the specified VF.  Setting this parameter to 0 disables rate limiting.  vf parameter
                      must be specified.  Please use new API max_tx_rate option instead.

                      max_tx_rate TXRATE - change the allowed maximum transmit bandwidth, in Mbps, for the specified VF.  Setting this parameter to 0 disables rate limiting.  vf
                      parameter must be specified.

                      min_tx_rate TXRATE - change the allowed minimum transmit bandwidth, in Mbps, for the specified VF.  Minimum TXRATE should  be  always  <=  Maximum  TXRATE.
                      Setting this parameter to 0 disables rate limiting.  vf parameter must be specified.

                      spoofchk on|off - turn packet spoof checking on or off for the specified VF.

                      query_rss  on|off - toggle the ability of querying the RSS configuration of a specific VF. VF RSS information like RSS hash key may be considered sensitive
                      on some devices where this information is shared between VF and PF and thus its querying may be prohibited by default.

                      state auto|enable|disable - set the virtual link state as seen by the specified VF. Setting to auto means a reflection of the PF link  state,  enable  lets
                      the VF to communicate with other VFs on this host even if the PF link state is down, disable causes the HW to drop any packets sent by the VF.

                      trust  on|off  -  trust  the specified VF user. This enables that VF user can set a specific feature which may impact security and/or performance. (e.g. VF
                      multicast promiscuous mode)

                      node_guid eui64 - configure node GUID for Infiniband VFs.

                      port_guid eui64 - configure port GUID for Infiniband VFs.

       xdp object | pinned | off
              set (or unset) a XDP ("eXpress Data Path") BPF program to run on every packet at driver level.  ip link output will indicate a xdp flag for the networking  device.
              If  the  driver  does not have native XDP support, the kernel will fall back to a slower, driver-independent "generic" XDP variant. The ip link output will in that
              case indicate xdpgeneric instead of xdp only. If the driver does have native XDP support, but the program is loaded under xdpgeneric object | pinned then the  ker‐
              nel  will use the generic XDP variant instead of the native one.  xdpdrv has the opposite effect of requesting that the automatic fallback to the generic XDP vari‐
              ant be disabled and in case driver is not XDP-capable error should be returned.  xdpdrv also disables hardware offloads.  xdpoffload in ip  link  output  indicates
              that the program has been offloaded to hardware and can also be used to request the "offload" mode, much like xdpgeneric it forces program to be installed specifi‐
              cally in HW/FW of the adapter.

              off (or none ) - Detaches any currently attached XDP/BPF program from the given device.

              object  FILE  -  Attaches a XDP/BPF program to the given device. The FILE points to a BPF ELF file (f.e. generated by LLVM) that contains the BPF program code, map
              specifications, etc. If a XDP/BPF program is already attached to the given device, an error will be thrown. If no XDP/BPF program is currently attached, the device
              supports XDP and the program from the BPF ELF file passes the kernel verifier, then it will be attached to the device. If the option -force is passed  to  ip  then
              any prior attached XDP/BPF program will be atomically overridden and no error will be thrown in this case. If no section option is passed, then the default section
              name  ("prog")  will  be assumed, otherwise the provided section name will be used. If no verbose option is passed, then a verifier log will only be dumped on load
              error.  See also EXAMPLES section for usage examples.

              section NAME - Specifies a section name that contains the BPF program code. If no section name is specified, the default one ("prog") will be used. This option  is
              to be passed with the object option.

              program NAME - Specifies the BPF program name that need to be attached. When the program name is specified, the section name parameter will be ignored. This option
              only works when iproute2 build with libbpf support.

              verbose - Act in verbose mode. For example, even in case of success, this will print the verifier log in case a program was loaded from a BPF ELF file.

              pinned  FILE  - Attaches a XDP/BPF program to the given device. The FILE points to an already pinned BPF program in the BPF file system. The option section doesn't
              apply here, but otherwise semantics are the same as with the option object described already.

       master DEVICE
              set master device of the device (enslave device).

       nomaster
              unset master device of the device (release device).

       addrgenmode eui64|none|stable_secret|random
              set the IPv6 address generation mode

              eui64 - use a Modified EUI-64 format interface identifier

              none - disable automatic address generation

              stable_secret - generate the interface identifier based on a preset
                /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/{default,DEVICE}/stable_secret

              random - like stable_secret, but auto-generate a new random secret if none is set

       link-netnsid
              set peer netnsid for a cross-netns interface

       type ETYPE TYPE_ARGS
              Change type-specific settings. For a list of supported types and arguments refer to the description of ip link add above. In addition to that, it  is  possible  to
              manipulate settings to slave devices:

       Bridge Slave Support
              For a link with master bridge the following additional arguments are supported:

              ip  link set type bridge_slave [ fdb_flush ] [ state STATE ] [ priority PRIO ] [ cost COST ] [ guard { on | off } ] [ hairpin { on | off } ] [ fastleave { on | off
              } ] [ root_block { on | off } ] [ learning { on | off } ] [ flood { on | off } ] [ proxy_arp { on | off } ] [ proxy_arp_wifi { on | off } ] [  mcast_router  MULTI‐
              CAST_ROUTER  ] [ mcast_fast_leave { on | off} ] [ bcast_flood { on | off } ] [ mcast_flood { on | off } ] [ mcast_to_unicast { on | off } ] [ group_fwd_mask MASK ]
              [ neigh_suppress { on | off } ] [ neigh_vlan_suppress { on | off } ] [ vlan_tunnel { on | off } ] [ isolated { on | off } ] [ locked { on | off } ] [ mab  {  on  |
              off } ] [ backup_port DEVICE ] [ nobackup_port ] [ backup_nhid NHID ]

                      fdb_flush - flush bridge slave's fdb dynamic entries.

                      state  STATE  -  Set port state.  STATE is a number representing the following states: 0 (disabled), 1 (listening), 2 (learning), 3 (forwarding), 4 (block‐
                      ing).

                      priority PRIO - set port priority (allowed values are between 0 and 63, inclusively).

                      cost COST - set port cost (allowed values are between 1 and 65535, inclusively).

                      guard { on | off } - block incoming BPDU packets on this port.

                      hairpin { on | off } - enable hairpin mode on this port. This will allow incoming packets on this port to be reflected back.

                      fastleave { on | off } - enable multicast fast leave on this port.

                      root_block { on | off } - block this port from becoming the bridge's root port.

                      learning { on | off } - allow MAC address learning on this port.

                      flood { on | off } - open the flood gates on this port, i.e. forward all unicast frames to this port also. Requires  proxy_arp  and  proxy_arp_wifi  to  be
                      turned off.

                      proxy_arp { on | off } - enable proxy ARP on this port.

                      proxy_arp_wifi { on | off } - enable proxy ARP on this port which meets extended requirements by IEEE 802.11 and Hotspot 2.0 specifications.

                      mcast_router  MULTICAST_ROUTER - configure this port for having multicast routers attached. A port with a multicast router will receive all multicast traf‐
                      fic.  MULTICAST_ROUTER may be either 0 to disable multicast routers on this port, 1 to let the system detect the presence of routers (this is the default),
                      2 to permanently enable multicast traffic forwarding on this port or 3 to enable multicast routers temporarily on this  port,  not  depending  on  incoming
                      queries.

                      mcast_fast_leave { on | off } - this is a synonym to the fastleave option above.

                      bcast_flood { on | off } - controls flooding of broadcast traffic on the given port. By default this flag is on.

                      mcast_flood { on | off } - controls whether a given port will flood multicast traffic for which there is no MDB entry. By default this flag is on.

                      mcast_to_unicast { on | off } - controls whether a given port will replicate packets using unicast instead of multicast. By default this flag is off.

                      group_fwd_mask  MASK  - set the group forward mask. This is the bitmask that is applied to decide whether to forward incoming frames destined to link-local
                      addresses, ie addresses of the form 01:80:C2:00:00:0X (defaults to 0, ie the bridge does not forward any link-local frames coming on this port).

                      neigh_suppress { on | off } - controls whether neigh discovery (arp and nd) proxy and suppression is enabled on the port. By default this flag is off.

                      neigh_vlan_suppress { on | off } - controls whether per-VLAN neigh discovery (arp and nd) proxy and suppression is enabled on the port. When on, the bridge
                      link option neigh_suppress has no effect and the per-VLAN state is set using the bridge vlan option neigh_suppress. By default this flag is off.

                      vlan_tunnel { on | off } - controls whether vlan to tunnel mapping is enabled on the port. By default this flag is off.

                      locked { on | off } - controls whether a port is locked or not. When locked, non-link-local frames received through the port are dropped unless an FDB  en‐
                      try  with  the MAC source address points to the port. The common use case is IEEE 802.1X where hosts can authenticate themselves by exchanging EAPOL frames
                      with an authenticator. After authentication is complete, the user space control plane can install a matching FDB entry to allow traffic from the host to be
                      forwarded by the bridge. When learning is enabled on a locked port, the no_linklocal_learn bridge option needs to be on to prevent the bridge from learning
                      from received EAPOL frames. By default this flag is off.

                      mab { on | off } - controls whether MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) is enabled on the port or not.  MAB can only be enabled  on  a  locked  port  that  has
                      learning  enabled.  When  enabled, FDB entries are learned from received traffic and have the "locked" FDB flag set. The flag can only be set by the kernel
                      and it indicates that the FDB entry cannot be used to authenticate the corresponding host. User space can decide to authenticate the host by replacing  the
                      FDB  entry  and  clearing the "locked" FDB flag. Locked FDB entries can roam to unlocked (authorized) ports in which case the "locked" flag is cleared. FDB
                      entries cannot roam to locked ports regardless of MAB being enabled or not. Therefore, locked FDB entries are only created if an FDB entry with  the  given
                      {MAC,  VID}  does  not already exist.  This behavior prevents unauthenticated hosts from disrupting traffic destined to already authenticated hosts. Locked
                      FDB entries act like regular dynamic entries with respect to forwarding and aging. By default this flag is off.

                      backup_port DEVICE - if the port loses carrier all traffic will be redirected to the configured backup port

                      nobackup_port - removes the currently configured backup port

                      backup_nhid NHID - the FDB nexthop object ID (see ip-nexthop(8)) to attach to packets being redirected to a backup port that has VLAN  tunnel  mapping  en‐
                      abled (via the vlan_tunnel option). Setting a value of 0 (default) has the effect of not attaching any ID.

       Bonding Slave Support
              For a link with master bond the following additional arguments are supported:

              ip link set type bond_slave [ queue_id ID ] [ prio PRIORITY ]

                      queue_id ID - set the slave's queue ID (a 16bit unsigned value).

                      prio PRIORITY - set the slave's priority for active slave re-selection during failover (a 32bit signed value). This option only valid for active-backup(1),
                      balance-tlb (5) and balance-alb (6) mode.

                      actor_port_prio  PRIORITY  -  set the slave's ad actor port priority for 802.3ad aggregation selection logic during failover (a 16bit unsigned value). This
                      option only valid for 802.3ad (4) mode.

       MACVLAN and MACVTAP Support
              Modify list of allowed macaddr for link in source mode.

              ip link set type { macvlan | macvap } [ macaddr COMMAND MACADDR ...  ]

              Commands:
                      add - add MACADDR to allowed list

                      set - replace allowed list

                      del - remove MACADDR from allowed list

                      flush - flush whole allowed list

              Update the broadcast/multicast queue length.

              ip link set type { macvlan | macvap } [ bcqueuelen  LENGTH ] [ bclim LIMIT ]

                      bcqueuelen LENGTH - Set the length of the RX queue used to process broadcast and multicast packets.  LENGTH  must  be  a  positive  integer  in  the  range
                      [0-4294967295].   Setting a length of 0 will effectively drop all broadcast/multicast traffic.  If not specified the macvlan driver default (1000) is used.
                      Note that all macvlans that share the same underlying device are using the same queue. The parameter here is a request, the actual queue length  used  will
                      be  the  maximum  length that any macvlan interface has requested.  When listing device parameters both the bcqueuelen parameter as well as the actual used
                      bcqueuelen are listed to better help the user understand the setting.

                      bclim LIMIT - Set the threshold for broadcast queueing.  LIMIT must be a 32-bit integer.  Setting this to -1 disables broadcast queueing altogether.   Oth‐
                      erwise a multicast address will be queued as broadcast if the number of devices using it is greater than the given value.

       DSA user port support
              For a link having the DSA user port type, the following additional arguments are supported:

              ip link set type dsa [ conduit DEVICE ]

                      conduit  DEVICE  -  change  the  DSA conduit (host network interface) responsible for handling the locally terminated traffic for the given DSA switch user
                      port. For a description of which network interfaces are suitable for serving as  conduit  interfaces  of  this  user  port,  please  see  https://docs.ker‐
                      nel.org/networking/dsa/configuration.html#affinity-of-user-ports-to-cpu-ports as well as what is supported by the driver in use.

                      master DEVICE - this is a synonym for "conduit".

   ip link show - display device attributes
       dev NAME (default)
              NAME specifies the network device to show.

       group GROUP
              GROUP specifies what group of devices to show.

       up     only display running interfaces.

       down   only display not running interfaces.

       master DEVICE
              DEVICE specifies the master device which enslaves devices to show.

       vrf NAME
              NAME specifies the VRF which enslaves devices to show.

       type TYPE
              TYPE specifies the type of devices to show.

              Note that the type name is not checked against the list of supported types - instead it is sent as-is to the kernel. Later it is used to filter the returned inter‐
              face list by comparing it with the relevant attribute in case the kernel didn't filter already. Therefore any string is accepted, but may lead to empty output.

       nomaster
              only show devices with no master

       novf   only show devices with no VF info

   ip link xstats - display extended statistics
       type TYPE
              TYPE specifies the type of devices to display extended statistics for.

   ip link afstats - display address-family specific statistics
       dev DEVICE
              DEVICE specifies the device to display address-family statistics for.

   ip link help - display help
       TYPE specifies which help of link type to display.

   GROUP
       may be a number or a string from /usr/share/iproute2/group or /etc/iproute2/group which can be manually filled and has precedence if exists.
