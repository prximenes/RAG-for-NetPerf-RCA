The Linux Kernel documentation¶
This is the top level of the kernel’s documentation tree.  Kernel
documentation, like the kernel itself, is very much a work in progress;
that is especially true as we work to integrate our many scattered
documents into a coherent whole.  Please note that improvements to the
documentation are welcome; join the linux-doc list at vger.kernel.org if
you want to help out.
Working with the development community¶
The essential guides for interacting with the kernel’s development
community and getting your work upstream.
- Development process
- Submitting patches
- Code of conduct
- Maintainer handbook
- All development-process docs
Internal API manuals¶
Manuals for use by developers working to interface with the rest of the
kernel.
- Core API
- Driver APIs
- Subsystems
- Locking
Development tools and processes¶
Various other manuals with useful information for all kernel developers.
- Licensing rules
- Writing documentation
- Development tools
- Testing guide
- Hacking guide
- Tracing
- Fault injection
- Livepatching
- Rust
User-oriented documentation¶
The following manuals are written for users of the kernel — those who are
trying to get it to work optimally on a given system and application
developers seeking information on the kernel’s user-space APIs.
- Administration
- Build system
- Reporting issues
- Userspace tools
- Userspace API
See also: the Linux man pages,
which are kept separately from the kernel’s own documentation.

platform firmware.
- Firmware
- Firmware and Devicetree
Architecture-specific documentation¶
- CPU architectures
- ARC architecture
- ARM Architecture
- ARM64 Architecture
- LoongArch Architecture
- m68k Architecture
- MIPS-specific Documentation
- Nios II Specific Documentation
- OpenRISC Architecture
- PA-RISC Architecture
- powerpc
- RISC-V architecture
- s390 Architecture
- SuperH Interfaces Guide
- Sparc Architecture
- x86-specific Documentation
- Xtensa Architecture
Other documentation¶
There are several unsorted documents that don’t seem to fit on other parts
of the documentation body, or may require some adjustments and/or conversion
to reStructuredText format, or are simply too old.
