                    Here’s a summary of the key points:

- Docker Desktop is free for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.
- Otherwise, it requires a paid subscription for professional use.
- Paid subscriptions are also required for government entities.
- The Docker Pro, Team, and Business subscriptions include commercial use of Docker Desktop.
