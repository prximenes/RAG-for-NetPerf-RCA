#### Handle sensitive information securely

Be cautious about including sensitive data in environment variables. Consider using [Secrets](../use-secrets.md) for managing sensitive information.

#### Understand environment variable precedence

Be aware of how Docker Compose handles the [precedence of environment variables](envvars-precedence.md) from different sources (`.env` files, shell variables, Dockerfiles).

#### Use specific environment files

Consider how your application adapts to different environments. For example development, testing, production, and use different `.env` files as needed.

#### Know interpolation

Understand how [interpolation](variable-interpolation.md) works within compose files for dynamic configurations.

#### Command line overrides

Be aware that you can [override environment variables](set-environment-variables.md#cli) from the command line when starting containers. This is useful for testing or when you have temporary changes.
