Learn how to update your organization information using the Admin Console.

## Update organization information

General organization information appears on your organization landing page in the Admin Console.

This information includes:

 - Organization Name
 - Company
 - Location
 - Website
 - Gravatar email: To add an avatar to your Docker account, create a [Gravatar account](https://gravatar.com/) and upload an avatar. Next, add your Gravatar email to your Docker account settings. It may take some time for your avatar to update in Docker.

To edit this information:

1. Sign in to the [Admin Console](https://app.docker.com/admin) and
select your organization from the top-left account drop-down.
1. Enter or update your organization’s details, then select **Save**.

## Next steps

After configuring your organization information, you can:

- [Configure single sign-on (SSO)](/manuals/enterprise/security/single-sign-on/configure.md)
- [Set up SCIM provisioning](/manuals/enterprise/security/provisioning/scim.md)
- [Manage domains](/manuals/enterprise/security/domain-management.md)
- [Create a company](new-company.md)
