The R language-specific guide teaches you how to containerize a R application using Docker. In this guide, you’ll learn how to:

- Containerize and run a R application
- Set up a local environment to develop a R application using containers
- Configure a CI/CD pipeline for a containerized R application using GitHub Actions
- Deploy your containerized R application locally to Kubernetes to test and debug your deployment

Start by containerizing an existing R application.
