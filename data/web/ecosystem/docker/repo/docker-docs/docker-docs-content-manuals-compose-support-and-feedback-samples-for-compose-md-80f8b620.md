The following samples show the various aspects of how to work with Docker
Compose. As a prerequisite, be sure to [install Docker Compose](/manuals/compose/install/_index.md)
if you have not already done so.

## Key concepts these samples cover

The samples should help you to:

- Define services based on Docker images using
  [Compose files](/reference/compose-file/_index.md)
- Understand the relationship between `compose.yaml` and
  [Dockerfiles](/reference/dockerfile/)
- Learn how to make calls to your application services from Compose files
- Learn how to deploy applications and services to a [swarm](/manuals/engine/swarm/_index.md)

## Awesome Compose samples

The Awesome Compose samples provide a starting point on how to integrate different frameworks and technologies using Docker Compose. All samples are available in the [Awesome-compose GitHub repo](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose) and are ready to run with `docker compose up`.
