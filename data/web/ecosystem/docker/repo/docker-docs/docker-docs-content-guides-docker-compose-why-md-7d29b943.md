Docker Compose is an essential tool for defining and running multi-container
Docker applications. Docker Compose simplifies the Docker experience, making it
easier for developers to create, manage, and deploy applications by using YAML
files to configure application services.

Docker Compose provides several benefits:

- Lets you define multi-container applications in a single YAML file.
- Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- Manages the startup and linking of multiple containers effortlessly.
- Streamlines development workflows and reduces setup time.
- Ensures that each service runs in its own container, avoiding conflicts.
