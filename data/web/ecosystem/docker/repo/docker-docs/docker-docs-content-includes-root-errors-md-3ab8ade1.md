> Receiving errors when trying to run without root?

> The `docker` user group exists but contains no users, which is why you’re required 
> to use `sudo` to run Docker commands. Continue to [Linux postinstall](/engine/install/linux-postinstall) 
> to allow non-privileged users to run Docker commands and for other optional configuration steps.
