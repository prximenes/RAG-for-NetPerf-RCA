                    With Compose, you can use built-in [YAML](https://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2765878) features to make your Compose file neater and more efficient. Anchors and aliases let you create re-usable blocks. This is useful if you start to find common configurations that span multiple services. Having re-usable blocks minimizes potential mistakes.
