The legacy versions of the Compose file reference has moved to the [V1 branch of the Compose repository](https://github.com/docker/compose/tree/v1/docs). They are no longer being actively maintained. 

The latest and recommended version of the Compose file format is defined by the [Compose Specification](_index.md). This format merges the 2.x and 3.x versions and is implemented by **Compose 1.27.0+**. For more information, see the[History and development of Docker Compose](/manuals/compose/intro/history.md).
